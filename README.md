# Games_with_Python

After taking my first programming class at Dixie State University, I wanted to learn more about Python, so, I recreated two classic games, "Hangman" and "Snake", and built my own version of a text adventure game. Even though they were small and simple projects, I learned a lot more about Python, as well as the fundamental concept of how to code in general. This is when I realized that in order to write better codes and to think more like a programmer, I need to spend a lot more time practicing and learning by myself.
